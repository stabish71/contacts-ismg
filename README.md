The Contacts SPA allows users to manage contacts with predefined job titles. Users can add new contacts with associated titles and search for contacts using keywords across all fields. The app leverages Laravel for the backend, providing RESTful API endpoints for contact-related actions. The frontend is built with html, css and jquery.
